# How does it works ?

 Frontend

The frontend application uses socket.io and canvas for binding with mstsc.js (my app is a fork of mstsc.js) backend. The front-end is in charge of bitmap decompression through rle.js file. This file is generated by Emscripten from rle.c which comes from rdesktop source.

 Backend

The backend application uses nodejs, express and socket.io as the web server. The main goal of the backend is to be a proxy between the web browser and the terminal server. It uses node-rdpjs for its rdp client.
